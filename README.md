# TextIT_Weather
Have you ever been in a situation where you're texting your friend, planning to meet up, and you need to check the weather before you head out, but you don't feel like opening a weather app and waiting for it to load, only to find out that you're out of data??....Ok, probably not. However, the TextIT_Weather app is your one-stop shop to get the current and hourly weather forecast, deliever to you via a text message. Just text any city, state(In that format) location in the U.S. of A to your Twilio number and you'll get the forecast for that location(Isn't it nice to get what you want), and no data is required!(You just need a network connection)In addition to downloading this Python script, you'll also need a Twilio account and number to text to. It's also higly recommended to download ngrok which creates a secure tunnel to your localhost. If you'd rather have someone  tell you how to use Twilio, rather than figuring it out, go to this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knxlmCVFAZI.*






*FYI: Once you get this running, there may be a 10-15 second delay to recieve the text message with the weather information. Also, the hourly weather forecast gets cutoff at the end; I will try to fix it if and when I get time.
